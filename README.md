# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This is the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

## Getting Started

Run `npm run start` to start the local server for development. 

### Prerequisites

* NPM
* Node

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

The Application will be bootstrapped on Port `3000` without any additional configuration. Visit the application on `http://locahost:300`

### And coding style tests

Code-Style from Udacity is being followed: https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html
